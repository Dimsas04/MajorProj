1,BoAt Airdopes Bluetooth Wireless Earphones,Amazon,Product,Product,False,3.9,"Been using these for a few days now and honestly, they’re worth the price. The sound is clean with good bass and clear vocals. Super comfortable to wear — even for long hours — and they fit snugly without slipping out.Battery life is great too, easily lasts a full day with the case. Calls are clear in normal environments, though a bit of background noise can sneak in outdoors.Overall, solid build, quick pairing, and good sound for the money. Definitely a great pick if you want reliable earbuds without spending too much.

Excellent bass"
5,BoAt Airdopes Bluetooth Wireless Earphones,Amazon,Product,Product,False,0.0,"Review after using one month. No doubts bass is good. On day one I found out left one isn’t working properly (self disconnect ) and tried multiple times to exchange but there isn’t any options. When I try it only give troubleshooting option. Left side isn’t working well. Charging it takes so much time to fully charged. No option to control volume either.
