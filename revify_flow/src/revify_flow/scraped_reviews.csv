1,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.1,"Realme Buds T300 are a great choice for this price range! Here's what I observed with the unit of product I received:Charging : They support Fast Charging. The most interesting and important part about this is that realme claims that 10 minutes of charge can provide around 7 hours of playback which I found to be true.Mic Quality : I tested the mic quality and it seemed interesting. It apparently depends on which mode you're using these buds which heavily affects the mic quality. For example, when I call with this without Noise Cancellation on, it actually cancels the noise from my audio. But when I don't use Noise Cancellation, it doesn't suppresses the background noise. And there's this issue I'm having with the device that my phone or my PC doesn't seems to be able to use the mic of this device while I'm not in a call. Mic quality is fine.Volume Control & Sound Quality : Here comes the best part. The Bass on this thing is extremely good. You can actually make it even better by using the realme link app to change the modes on this device. All in all, it's great for music listeners. This product is recommended if you're looking for a good music listening experience at the this price range.Appearance : There is no doubt that this thing looks absolutely professional. It has a really sleek design and it feels very smooth when you hold it.Build Quality : I don't know if it's just me but I feel like the build quality of this thing isn't that good. Especially the lid of the case. When I open the case, I have a feeling that the lid might break if I push it a bit too hard. Of course, that wouldn't happen and I tried it. The lid of the case, overall feels a bit loose. I don't know if that's a defect in the unit I got or is it the standard. Either way, I'm not really satisfied with this defect.Button Control : There is a button to control media on this device. There are three possible combinations that one can use on both the sides of the earbuds. It comes with defaults but you can configure the buttons in the realme link app. I personally found the usage of buttons quite limited. But it's good for simplicity of controls.Noise Cancellation : BY FAR, THE BEST PART. Personally, I'm someone who comes from a community that uses headphones a lot. I have one wired headphones with me which used to be my main before I got this. I have ALWAYS wanted Noise Cancellation and since I used headphones that didn't support it. It was a big thing for me. This was the best part in my opinion of these earbuds. They support upto -30db of Noise Cancellation and it actually works damn well. To get Ambient Noise Cancellation in this budget is quite crazy.Bluetooth 5.3 : It has Bluetooth 5.3 and Wake & Pair and in my opinion, it works pretty well.IP55 Rating : It has a rating of IP55 so it's resistant from water splashes/sweat and light amount of dust. Of course, I had to test it and it seems that it really is resistant to water splashes and dust. I tested it in such environments and it still works great. No problemo.Dolby Atmos : It also has Dolby Atmos which, personally, I didn't notice that much but when I was testing this feature, I shifted my focus to the 360° audio and it surely seemed like it works and pretty well at that. It could be my imagination though so don't take my word for it here.App : You can use realme link app to further configure the settings of this device and it's pretty decent. You get options to change audio modes, button functionality, etc. So it's pretty decent.In conclusion, I think that these earbuds are extremely good for their price range and you should definitely go for it if you're a music lover or you just need earbuds for day-to-day tasks.I hope my review was helpful to the readers. Thank you for your quality time!","5.0 out of 5 stars
Really Good Earbuds!!!"
2,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,Got this realme buds at offer for 1799. And for this price point and quality these are awesome. Nice bass‚ vocal‚ and mic and after turning 360⁰ degree spatial audio it sounds really good also gives extra loudnessNoise cancelling is soo good at loude places. we can customise noise cancelling in three levels. transperancy mode is okok can hear outer noise and if someone is speaking. comes with app support and Google fast pairingDesign and sound is 9/10 . comfort is 8/10 (Need to change the eartips if uncomfortable). The only problem is Whiteand purple colour can easily get scratches black comes with matt finish.so consider using cover for white and purple colour. afterall i would recommend these earbuds go for it 🔥👍🏻,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent earbuds 🔥"
3,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"One of the best buys you can ever make. The best earphones you can get around 2k. Very nice ANC. It does make even the loud noises around you very quiet. Take the earbuds fit test on realme link app and get the best fit according to yours ears, ehich makes noises very quiet. The only isssue I face is, if you are in noisy area with ANC on, the mic doesn't listen to your voice correctly. With ANC on in noisy area you will have to go to normal mode first for calling, otherwse the other person will not be able to clearly listen to you. It happens only in noisy and ANC on time.Its mic is way too op. I am playing BGMI in my house and it captures people talking in other rooms very clearly. It sometimes is annoying.","5.0 out of 5 stars
The best tws in the 2k budget"
4,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"Sound quality is very good, nice looking, Music quality is also good. battery life is very good.but three times I changed the headphones from the service centre because the right earbud did not work.Realme warranty policy is very good and executive behaviour of service centre was pretty good.","5.0 out of 5 stars
Very good experience.........must buy."
5,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"Buds are very fine in sound but if you was a user of neckband then it make you feel less louder in compare to them.But sound is clear, fitting is good, battery backup is fine, but if it comes to gaming then it not recommended, you can go for the realme buds wireless 5 bcz I have used them, but anc is better than neckband charging time is good, size of the case is very comfortable.Touch controls are very precise and good. Talking about the connectivity means if you are in outdoor then it make you feel loosing the connection and it feels like breaking.At the time of talking, the voice is little heavy going to the other side you can call recorde and heare that sound.....Overall all 4.5/5 really never disappoint, it's my 5 sound product from realme and it's nice 👍😌","4.0 out of 5 stars
Value for money 💰 if you got this under 1899,"
6,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"Just got today. Everything is top notch. Sound quality is very good. The ANC is superd, reduces almost 90 percent of the sound in a crowded place. So far I am satisfied with the product. Got it at 1800. It's value for money","5.0 out of 5 stars

7,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,Good product but doesn't fit properly,"3.0 out of 5 stars
Sound is decent,anc is ok,the main deal breaker is that the product doesn't fit properly in one ear"
8,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"Pros - sound. Very clear. Not harsh. No excess boomy/ugly bass. Everything is adequate. Battery life is also good. I never felt I was going out of charge. I use it a lot throughout the day for music.Comfort is good. Colours are good.Cons - touch controls are not so convenient. Not many options. No single tap option. All the controls are double or triple touch. The app is huge, definitely some shady data collecting app. Sure they sell it to others. Whatever.ANC is something I've not used a lot. Take my opinion with a grain of salt. It's great to remove fan/wind/car noises. But it doesn't remove people talking, or high pitched noises. I'm happy with it, i don't use it much anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars
Very happy with this"
9,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"Been using this product for a week and i must say, the audio quality is remarkable, great lows mids and highs, also the bass is great too. ANC is promising, just make sure you use the earbuds pieces (idk what its called) that matches your ears and you'll notice a significant difference. Transparency mode is great too. This product also supports dolby atmos and 3d spatial sound! Touch controls too, that you can configure via 'Realme link' app.About app:The app has various configurations like battery status, sound effects mode, that include:1. Clear vocals- for obviously clear vocals lol2. Nature balance- idk what this means tbh, but from what i know, it automatically adjusts the sound depending on what is playing.3. Clear bass- best sound effect mode for bass lovers, not to heavy, not to light, just perfect (recommended)4. Bass boost- meh, i dont think think you'd want to live in a constant barrage of earthquake... its a headache (its not that strong, i think clear bass is more than enough in my opinion)It also comes with equalizer where you add various presets and create sound profiles.Spatial Audio: let me copy paste from what it says in the app.... Brand new 360 degree immersive surround sound experience, so you you feel like you're right at the center of the action.Volume enhancer: It further increases the volume and enhance its quality. You know the meaning of enhance don't you?Other settings: Game modeyes, game mode it reduces latency ofcourse! that too- significantly! good for gaming 50ms latency i guess?Find my phone: finds your phone. Let me copy paste again.... When your headset is connected to your phone, press the left or right earbud four times continuously to find your phone. Your phone will then start to ring.Button settings: double tap, triple tap, touch and hold...actions: play/pause, previous track, switch noise control modes.... you can configure these settings with button settings! i like itoverall rating: (for the price segment)comfort: 3.6/5sound: lows: 4/5 mids: 4/5 highs: 5/5. bass: 5/5 overall: 4.5/5ANC:  5/5. Best Active noise cancellation you'll get at this price right now.stereo seperation: Bad, sound is a bit inclined toward right side. I had to use the audio balance bar slider from settings to align the sound. MAYBE IT WAS MY PHONE's ISSUE? IDKlooks: small, cute, neat, and its surprisingly light weight! both colors are very good! (i have the black one) 5/5case: premium, sturdy and good build quality, fits in palm, it wont disappoint you, open and close the case, its quite satisfying. i do that when im bored. its so cute i want to eat it. 5/5Mic and calling: Nice, I really have no idea about it because i don't have anyone to talk with. Maybe look for other reviews about this?! sorry :(  ?/5OVerall rating: 4.38134124/5OTHER: just go for it my friend, if you want more in this price, well goodluck waiting. You wont find better ear-pods in this price. I bet my left ball.EDIT: Yes it was my phone's issue, the stereo seperation is balanced, i checked on my brother's phone. Also, if you are going for white color then dont forget the case for the white earpods is glossy unlike black that is matte, and the white earpods material is glossier than the black one too, i have both colors. So if you're looking for matte finish then just go for black color, it looks more premium and it looks better than the white ones.Thanks for reading!-YASH","4.0 out of 5 stars

16,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"The earbuds is really worth for money. I searched many earbuds especially for noise cancellation for attending meetings. I bought 3 months back. We can changed the mode such as Noise cancellation, Transparent. If we use realme link app for earbuds we can listen white noise like audio'sPros1. Noise Cancellation (85%)2. Mic quality (90-95%)3. Connectivity (less than 5 sec)4. Good audio effect while listening music5. Long lasting Battery (weekly once I charged the case)6. Case and earbuds are very small and less weightCons1.

Realme T310 Earbuds Experience"
17,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"I have been struggling with the wired earphones a lot lately. I always used to think that wired earphones are much better when it comes to the sound quality and the latency. And, the statement still stands true. However, what I didn't knew was that the bluetooth earphones also shines in their own department.The wired ones although provide you great sound quality and minimum latency but keeping  them without tangling them is a hassle in its own. They tangle too fast and in an unsightly manner as well. Bluetooth ones completely removed this problem.This realme earset comes with a sleek beautiful black cover case paired with light cream colour in the inside. A great combination of colours. The package offers you a short lead cable for fast charging. I just connect the cable to my phone's charger and it easily charges it to full within a few hours. Even, if you charge it for a few minutes, the battery will easily last for some hours. It has a good battery backup.The sound quality is good too. It's loud and clear. They fit very well in your ears. And, there are several 'touch response' functions as well.Double tap any earpiece and whatever you're listening will pause. Double tap again to resume it. Holding an earpiece will activate its noise cancellation mode. And, holding it again will switch it to the normal mode.And, I must say that the noise cancellation is pretty good. Being a student, I use it in library to concentrate on my study and it easily repels all the noises from your surroundings. If the sound is too loud then it will face some difficulties. For example : If you're sitting right next to a cooler then, you'll be able to hear a little sound. But, it's still a lot better than hearing it in actual.It's portable too. You can easily carry it within your pocket. Now, the two problems I faced in it were the 1) Usage while on calls and, 2) Latency. I was on a road sauntering for a walk when my friend called me. I had my realme earpiece. I picked up his call and answered and he couldn't clearly hear my voice. He asked me, whether I was eating anything. I had to immediately switch it off. The other problem is its latency. These are not meant for gaming at all. If you're a gamer then you must absolutely stay away from these. You'll fire a bullet and it would take some time for you to hear its sound. Because, the latency is high in this one. I didn't mean that it's obviously noticable. But, you'll feel the difference during your gameplay. You'll be able to tell that the responses are coming a little slower than your actions.These are the only problems with this earpiece. It's not made for the calls. And, certainly not for the gaming either. You can talk to people if you're in a closed room but if you're outside then that's a straight NO!Overall, they are really good. I bought them in the diwali sale around 2k or something. So, I'll advice you to either wait for the sale or just go with other options if you want. I have already mentioned the issues it has. If you don't talk with earpiece attached then you can totally buy this. I'm leaving 4 stars just because of the above listed problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars

26,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"The Realme Buds T310 truly impressed me with their sound and music quality—clear audio, deep bass, and great overall performance. But what surprised me even more was their durability.I’ve dropped them from my hands 4–5 times, and once, the right earbud actually got run over by a car on a busy road. Unbelievably, it still works perfectly. There are a few light scratches on the plastic, but no internal damage at all. The sound is just as good as day one.That said, I’d definitely recommend getting a silicone cover for extra protection—just to keep them looking clean and safe from surface wear.Overall, these earbuds are not only great in performance but also built to survive the unexpected.101% recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars

Realme 310"
29,headphones,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"--> ANC is 4/10, it puts pressure on your earsdrums and leads to minor headaches on continued hearing. It also barely cancels anything. Like it only stops the sound of a running AC or an overhead Fan but cannot stop the noises of a TV playing in the next room.--> Transparency mode 9.5/10, this is the one thing that I really, really liked about this earphone is that with transparency mode on, you sometimes forget that youre wearing earbuds (except for that random burst of air from the overheard fan which hits the earbud's microphones and causes loud audible wooshing noises.I can comfortably talk to a person infront of me while wearing the headphones, no need to take it off to listen to what they are saying.--> Spacial sound 6/10. With surround sound on, you cannot differentiate between footsteps at 90 and 270 degrees away from you, in laymans terms, If there is an enemy right in front of you and another right behind u, you cant differentiate between their footsteps.--> Sound quality is a solid 7/10, it doesnt give you perfect audio and soundstage but it does its job and thats understandable in its price range. A brief gist of the audio quality would be ""better than 80 rupee earphones but worse than 5000 rupees headphones. You can also use an equalizer to fill in where its default settings lack, but that barely raises the rating to 7.5/10. If you are an audiophile, I wouldn't suggest you to buy this, but if are tight on budget, then go right ahead.--> Build quality 7/10Plastic all around but still feels good in your hands. The case and earbuds are surprisingly quite durable. The earbuds plug in comfortably and stay there without any problems (I am using medium size tips).--> Connectivity: 8/10, It is really good, I can listen to a song clearly with my phone being in my bedroom and me being in the bathroom, which, mind you, is like 10-15 meters away. Only reason why i gave it 8/10 is that when I am listening and I go to scratch my chin or somewhere under the earphone, it somehow blocks the connection and it stops playing for a second and resumes like 0.75-1 second after removing my hand.--> Features: 9/10, getting ANC (however half baked it is) at this price range is really amazing, the bass drivers are also good and ENC during calls is also good.--> Clarity 7/10, clarity is kinda weird, like when I first connected my phone and listened to a song, its vocals sounded like you know, when you play your phone at full volume and put it under a pillow and try listening to it? Yeah it sounded like that BUT the instrumentals were perfectly clear, like crystal clear. I fixed this by using equalizer and then the clarity was good enough.So yeah, overall I would recommend this earphone to every other normal person, but not to audiophiles. At this price range, its features are good, but they couldve been better. So over all 8/10 or 4/5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars
