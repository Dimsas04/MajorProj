1,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.2,"Alright everyone , please read this review carefully as it's 6 july 2025 today and on the 23rd of August 2025 , i will have spent 2 years using these awesome and marvellous earbuds... These have been 2 years of extreme , rigorous and very very careless usage and these earphones are still in prime condition, needless to add I'm an avid consumer of music ,l wear my earbuds almost all day long , I've worn them in the gym , while running , they've seen a lot of sweat , a lot of earwax , most of the days ,i fall asleep while wearing them and get up with them either under them or on the floor, I've been very very merciless with these earbuds , I have not used them ,I have exploited them, after allll of this ,  they're still in prime condition, the mic on these works extremely well, they charge pretty quickly , the box takes a little longer to get fully charged but it lasts for a long time , call quality, voice quality , everything is awesome , their response to your touch is also very durable and awesome , it happens ever so oftent that I'm in the gym and my phone is drenched in sweat and it's screen starts malfunctioning and as a result I can't take calls , but thanks to these earphones , even after all the sweat and moisture they respond to my touch instantly amd I'm able to take calls , in the gym, while driving, 2 wheelers , 4 wheelers , everything...you know I lost their charging box somewhere , so I purchased another set of the same earphones just for the box and im still using the old earbuds with the new box , I have dropped them quite roughly several times , one or two times I have thrown them away because I was angry due to some reason and they're still going one without an ounce of reduction in quality ,  this is why I'm calling them marvellous... After such rough and extreme usage , i just can't find any big noticable flaw in them.... But yes , I'll like to add that everything depreciates with time , after 2 years of usage , their batter life isn't as good as when they were new , but the sound quality ,the durability, it's still 90% of how it was when they were new...There may be some people who are extra extra critical and would say they give 4.6 to music , 3. Blah blah blah to sound , to bass , don't bother listening to nerds and wannabe tech gurus , go for it , best in class , marvel of engineering , this is gonna be one of those few purchases that youre gonna be proud of , over and out...","5.0 out of 5 stars

2,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"I would have given 5 stars but the only issue I am facing is they are not filtering the wind noise during a call. May be a software update can resolve it.Otherwise, One plus nord 3r earbuds are perfect in sound output, good bass, battery backup is amazing in this price range. The earbuds are comfortable in ears and also filters background noise during calls but only issue is not handling wind noise.","4.0 out of 5 stars
Perfect earbuds but wind noise during calls are troublesome"
3,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"Reviewing after 1 year of purchase and usage.Under this price this is the best basic tws available, which is durable and with no issues like in other companies' similar range products(boat, realme, noise, etc etc), such as the case battery doesn't charge or the ear pods don't charge or the pin doesn't connect.I have seen other people around me with other tws, failing after 1year or within 1 year.Just one issue, with several connected devices around, the pods sometimes don't connect. Solution is to put the pods in the case and plug it to the charger once for few seconds. It gets recalibrated.I didn't drop the ear pods much, maybe once or twice. And always charge with a normal charger, not a fast charger. It takes at around 2 hours, but even with 2-3+ hours of calls/playback everyday, it goes 5days - 1 week with 1 charge. And I use it daily.Can also be used as single ear pods, but the microphone quality drops, understandingly.The fit is fine. Won't drop off easily.The touch controls does what they are supposed to. I keep it very basic, just forward/stop/stop/answer/cut calls. Within these, it works fine.Within this price range, ( 1600 ) the sound is very decent and as expected. It won't blow your mind, but you won't feel any difference in your day to day usage.Range is also decent.No ANC. Was not looking for one.Overall, very good basic tws. 👍🏽","5.0 out of 5 stars
A very good basic tws."
4,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"One of the most striking aspects of the Nord Buds 3r is the design and build quality, especially the premium matte finish. This choice of material lends a sleek, non-glossy, and sophisticated feel that elevates the earbuds well beyond their price tag.For the price, the sound quality is genuinely impressive. The sound profile is distinctly bass-heavy. However, it's worth noting that at higher volume levels, the sound fidelity can suffer, the punchiness can give way to distortion, making it difficult to feel all the beats clearly.The battery performance is nothing short of amazing. The capacity of both the buds and the charging case allows for near week-long usage without needing to search for an outlets.","5.0 out of 5 stars
The Budget Battery Beast with quality sound output."
5,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"So here's my review after using it for a month:Sound quality is good.It fits comfortably and can be used during physical exercise.Excellent battery life atleast for now. I charge once for two weeks after using daily for 2 hours.Also no connectivity issues faced.Very durable.The features to control settings of earphones with heymelody app is nice. If only they could allow us tonset long press for voice assistant it would be perfect.But during a call it's difficult for people listening to you to hear clearly, especially in crowded places. It might be good enough if you speak loudly but that's weird in public. So I think microphone can be improved.Overall a great product for 1.4k.Also the sticker they sent was nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars
One month review - Good product"
6,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"The build quality is good of the case and the buds. The case takes some time to charge. The buds charge quickly. I noticed that the right earbud usually drops 10% lower first  than the left earbud when I'm using them. Remember to remove the plastic stickers inside the case or the buds won't charge. The battery backup is excellent so far, cant say exactly how many hours I get of use from them but very happy with them. I got the deep grey coloured ones.I get very good range on these, more than 5-meters but I noticed it depends on the device, old devices don't give such long range.The mic is good sounding, others can hear me fine when calling, online or on network calls. The mic won't be of that high use in a heavily packed mumbai local train setting though, the ENC feature is effective but not like ANC quality.The tap controls work fine too and each earbud can be assigned the various tap functions or even disabled. For instance I have the right earbud set to switch between two devices by long press hold. There is a noticeable sound that can be heard when the tap is acknowledged by the device.These come with three different size ear tips/cushions. I found the factory fitted one comfortable enough to not bother trying the others.The sound profile of these tws is centered around extra bass. I have set the media output to Standard (SBC) which helps lower the overall smoothness and adjust to my liking with the Custom EQ settings. Dolby atmos isn't required to be activated I feel, I liked the sound of the buds without it on.I am used to Realme Buds 2 wired earphones. I find those very comfortable to wear. I used to believe those were bass heavy but these buds 2r definitely have more bass than those. The sound in comparison sounds more spread out/separation in stereo with the wired realme buds 2. The oneplus 2r stereo sound is too centered, no option to increase the space between the Left & Right channels in the bluetooth app, will check with the dobly atmos settings if anything can be changed there.Overall I am happy with the purchase but should have brought the 3r or 3pro for more controlled bass. I choose the 2r because the reviews on the 3r had complaints regarding ear fitting and quick rust formation on pin contacts. Anyways, lets see how these last in my usage, I will update the review if any issues are found.","5.0 out of 5 stars
Bass heavy sound"
7,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"The OnePlus Nord Buds 2r are highly regarded as good value-for-money earbuds, with their primary strengths lying in their sound quality and robust feature set for a budget-friendly price point.Key Positive Features (Achhiya Batoow)Impressive Sound Quality: They feature large 12.4mm dynamic drivers with a titanium coating that deliver powerful, thumping bass and clear vocals.

And the build quality also good aswell. But the true power is used when the buds are connected to oneplus phones.

Immense sound"
9,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"OnePlus Nord Buds 3r TWS Earbuds Review (After 1 Week of Use)I’ve been using the OnePlus Nord Buds 3r for about a week now, and I’m really happy with how they’ve performed so far. For the price, these earbuds offer great value and deliver a smooth overall experience.Design and ComfortThe design of the Nord Buds 3r is clean, minimal, and stylish. I have the black version, and the matte finish gives it a premium look. The charging case is compact and fits easily in my pocket. The earbuds themselves are lightweight and sit comfortably in the ears. I’ve used them for long sessions—both while listening to music and watching videos—and I haven’t felt any discomfort or pain. The ear tips fit snugly and help with passive noise isolation, which is great when using them in public or noisy environments.Sound QualityThe sound quality is surprisingly good for a budget TWS. The bass is punchy, which makes songs sound lively, but it doesn’t overpower the vocals or instruments. Mids and highs are also clear and detailed. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or watching YouTube, the sound is enjoyable. Of course, it’s not at the level of premium earbuds, but for daily use, it’s more than enough. You also get some EQ options through the HeyMelody app, which lets you tweak the sound slightly based on your preference.Battery LifeBattery life is one of the strong points of these earbuds. I’ve used them for around 7 to 8 hours on a single charge, and the charging case adds more than 20 extra hours. That’s more than enough for my daily use. The fast charging is also super helpful—a quick 10-minute charge gives me about 2 hours of playback, which is great when I’m in a rush.ConnectivityPairing the Nord Buds 3r with my phone was simple and fast. They use Bluetooth 5.3, which provides a stable connection. I haven’t had any dropouts or lag while watching videos or during voice calls. The auto-connect feature works well too—just open the case and they connect to the last paired device quickly.Calls and Noise IsolationWhile these earbuds don’t have active noise cancellation (ANC), the in-ear design helps block out some outside noise naturally. I’ve taken a few calls using them, and the microphone quality is decent. People on the other end said they could hear me clearly, even when I was walking outside.Water ResistanceThese earbuds come with an IPX4 rating, which means they can handle sweat and light splashes. I’ve used them during a light workout, and they performed without any issues.Final ThoughtsAfter using the OnePlus Nord Buds 3r for a week, I can say they’re a great option in the budget segment. They’re comfortable, sound good, last long, and are easy to use. If you’re looking for affordable wireless earbuds for music, calls, and daily use, these are definitely worth considering. They may not have high-end features, but they get the basics right—and that’s what matters most.","4.0 out of 5 stars

24,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"One of the most striking aspects of the Nord Buds 3r is the design and build quality, especially the premium matte finish. This choice of material lends a sleek, non-glossy, and sophisticated feel that elevates the earbuds well beyond their price tag.For the price, the sound quality is genuinely impressive. The sound profile is distinctly bass-heavy. However, it's worth noting that at higher volume levels, the sound fidelity can suffer, the punchiness can give way to distortion, making it difficult to feel all the beats clearly.The battery performance is nothing short of amazing. The capacity of both the buds and the charging case allows for near week-long usage without needing to search for an outlets.","5.0 out of 5 stars
The Budget Battery Beast with quality sound output."
25,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"So here's my review after using it for a month:Sound quality is good.It fits comfortably and can be used during physical exercise.Excellent battery life atleast for now. I charge once for two weeks after using daily for 2 hours.Also no connectivity issues faced.Very durable.The features to control settings of earphones with heymelody app is nice. If only they could allow us tonset long press for voice assistant it would be perfect.But during a call it's difficult for people listening to you to hear clearly, especially in crowded places. It might be good enough if you speak loudly but that's weird in public. So I think microphone can be improved.Overall a great product for 1.4k.Also the sticker they sent was nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars
One month review - Good product"
26,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"The build quality is good of the case and the buds. The case takes some time to charge. The buds charge quickly. I noticed that the right earbud usually drops 10% lower first  than the left earbud when I'm using them. Remember to remove the plastic stickers inside the case or the buds won't charge. The battery backup is excellent so far, cant say exactly how many hours I get of use from them but very happy with them. I got the deep grey coloured ones.I get very good range on these, more than 5-meters but I noticed it depends on the device, old devices don't give such long range.The mic is good sounding, others can hear me fine when calling, online or on network calls. The mic won't be of that high use in a heavily packed mumbai local train setting though, the ENC feature is effective but not like ANC quality.The tap controls work fine too and each earbud can be assigned the various tap functions or even disabled. For instance I have the right earbud set to switch between two devices by long press hold. There is a noticeable sound that can be heard when the tap is acknowledged by the device.These come with three different size ear tips/cushions. I found the factory fitted one comfortable enough to not bother trying the others.The sound profile of these tws is centered around extra bass. I have set the media output to Standard (SBC) which helps lower the overall smoothness and adjust to my liking with the Custom EQ settings. Dolby atmos isn't required to be activated I feel, I liked the sound of the buds without it on.I am used to Realme Buds 2 wired earphones. I find those very comfortable to wear. I used to believe those were bass heavy but these buds 2r definitely have more bass than those. The sound in comparison sounds more spread out/separation in stereo with the wired realme buds 2. The oneplus 2r stereo sound is too centered, no option to increase the space between the Left & Right channels in the bluetooth app, will check with the dobly atmos settings if anything can be changed there.Overall I am happy with the purchase but should have brought the 3r or 3pro for more controlled bass. I choose the 2r because the reviews on the 3r had complaints regarding ear fitting and quick rust formation on pin contacts. Anyways, lets see how these last in my usage, I will update the review if any issues are found.","5.0 out of 5 stars

Immense sound"
29,OnePlus Wireless Earbuds Drivers Playback,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"OnePlus Nord Buds 3r TWS Earbuds Review (After 1 Week of Use)I’ve been using the OnePlus Nord Buds 3r for about a week now, and I’m really happy with how they’ve performed so far. For the price, these earbuds offer great value and deliver a smooth overall experience.Design and ComfortThe design of the Nord Buds 3r is clean, minimal, and stylish. I have the black version, and the matte finish gives it a premium look. The charging case is compact and fits easily in my pocket. The earbuds themselves are lightweight and sit comfortably in the ears. I’ve used them for long sessions—both while listening to music and watching videos—and I haven’t felt any discomfort or pain. The ear tips fit snugly and help with passive noise isolation, which is great when using them in public or noisy environments.Sound QualityThe sound quality is surprisingly good for a budget TWS. The bass is punchy, which makes songs sound lively, but it doesn’t overpower the vocals or instruments. Mids and highs are also clear and detailed. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or watching YouTube, the sound is enjoyable. Of course, it’s not at the level of premium earbuds, but for daily use, it’s more than enough. You also get some EQ options through the HeyMelody app, which lets you tweak the sound slightly based on your preference.Battery LifeBattery life is one of the strong points of these earbuds. I’ve used them for around 7 to 8 hours on a single charge, and the charging case adds more than 20 extra hours. That’s more than enough for my daily use. The fast charging is also super helpful—a quick 10-minute charge gives me about 2 hours of playback, which is great when I’m in a rush.ConnectivityPairing the Nord Buds 3r with my phone was simple and fast. They use Bluetooth 5.3, which provides a stable connection. I haven’t had any dropouts or lag while watching videos or during voice calls. The auto-connect feature works well too—just open the case and they connect to the last paired device quickly.Calls and Noise IsolationWhile these earbuds don’t have active noise cancellation (ANC), the in-ear design helps block out some outside noise naturally. I’ve taken a few calls using them, and the microphone quality is decent. People on the other end said they could hear me clearly, even when I was walking outside.Water ResistanceThese earbuds come with an IPX4 rating, which means they can handle sweat and light splashes. I’ve used them during a light workout, and they performed without any issues.Final ThoughtsAfter using the OnePlus Nord Buds 3r for a week, I can say they’re a great option in the budget segment. They’re comfortable, sound good, last long, and are easy to use. If you’re looking for affordable wireless earbuds for music, calls, and daily use, these are definitely worth considering. They may not have high-end features, but they get the basics right—and that’s what matters most.","4.0 out of 5 stars
