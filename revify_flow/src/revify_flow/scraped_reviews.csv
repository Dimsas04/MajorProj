4,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,I ordered 7 number shoe which is exactly my feet size but this product is way too small for the described size. Don't buy it now they are even denying product return.,"1.0 out of 5 stars
too small for the described size"
5,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,False,1.0,"Light Weight - you can wear them for long hours.Fits perfect - fitting is just perfect because of the shape of shoe.Looks good - Looks premium and go with lot of jeanse shades. (I can speak about the black).Value for money - before receiving the shoe i thought it was a little costly deal but when I looked and held the product I truly found it value for money and since it was in high demand it went sold-out and returned with a higher price (on Myntra too). Addidas is a well trusted brand and I bought Addidas after 4 years as I tried Puma shoes but I must say Addidas is way better, a bit costly because comfort and quality come with a price.It's even a good deal if you get it for 3000. ( My view)","5.0 out of 5 stars
First - Comfort, Then - Looks and then good brand all ogether!"
6,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"When I wore first time, I could not realize because of its overall softness.  But the second one, when I went for a long walk (Just walk), I could feet the tightness on right foot!!  Yes, Right foot!!  Actually my left foot is bit bigger than the right, so technically my left foot should be tighter, but here its actually the way opposite and after the walk I got blisters on my right little finger..!!Now out of return date, I cannot return the shoes too..UPDATE - But comparing Reebok shoes, this one much better..  I tried almost 10 shoes from Reebok, Adidas, Skecters and Asics..  But found this one to be better of all..  Yes, I felt it was defective at first and yes It was but uncomfortable during initial days of walk..  But now after months of use, No such blisters on finger..  So fine for now..  Also ordering another pair for further use..And yes, the type of socks also matters..  I started wearing the thinnest socks for Hush puppies and now its all good..","3.0 out of 5 stars

10,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,True,5.0,"A little background about myself - I run regularly (mostly in parks so hard ground).The packaging box looked like it was old which means it was probably recycled so that’s a good thing.The shoes came in good condition. I am UK 7 but I ordered UK 8. It was slightly loose fitting without socks but after wearing socks, it was very comfortableI could slip my feet inside the shoe easily with a small gap between the toe and the end of the shoe inside. The sole looks sturdy and has threads to offer sufficient grip. For a price of 2k this looks extremely promising.","4.0 out of 5 stars
First look, good fit, very comfortable, very affordable"
11,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"The shoes are good, fitted well and well cushioned. I bought them for my Dad, so they'll be mostly used for walking and not running. The delivery experience was marred by very poor packaging, which is not expected from Amazon. The shoe box came without the Amazon wrap packaging and just had a single cello tape wrapped around. Not sure if the packaging was tampered, but the shoes were in good condition.","4.0 out of 5 stars
Good product marred by bad delivery experience"
12,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,The shoes arrived within 2 days of order. The product was definitely original. Fitting is perfect as per the size. Colour is brighter than given in photo which i liked. Grip was made of rubber. Only thing i would have liked is if they could have made the whole grip out of rubber and packaging could have been better. All in all it does the job and is best in price range.,"4.0 out of 5 stars

19,Adidas Night Pulse Runmagica Running,Amazon,Product,Product,False,1.0,"I had ordered size 8. The shoes fit perfectly, with or without socks. Ofcourse, the looks are eye catching, which is what you expect from a Brand like Adidas. Deal was a steal. ✌️. However, initially the sole will make noise as it is a fresh one. With regular use (wear and tear), it will reduce in some time. Good for running.","5.0 out of 5 stars
