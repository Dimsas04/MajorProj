3,Suitcase,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,To start with...AMT Ivy is definitely a good buy considering the price and the quality it offers.The wheels are smooth and glide well in ramps and even on slightly uneven and not so smooth surfaces also.The compartmentation management is up to mark...not excellent and a small pouch for daily use items could have been well deserved.The quality is sturdy and the telescopic handle is also quite free and strong for movement.The body is not very strong but since it is PP material....I would rate it 5 star in this price.It is not Scratch resistant...but the black color looks nice and very elegant for frequent uses.,"5.0 out of 5 stars

7,Suitcase,Amazon,Product,Product,True,4.0,"The suitcase came much smaller then it was described. I had to order a bigger one and give the small one back. The currier, who should pick the small suitcase up, was very ignorant (he had a call during our talk and made me wait for a long time) and incompetent. Instead of having the returning code with himself, he demanded it from me and finally didn't pick the suitcase up. I had to request the return twice. Due to the wrong description of the product and incompetence of the currier I was close to missing my flight.","1.0 out of 5 stars
